<p><br><font size="4"><b>Syllabus: </b></font>

This course is an introduction to mathematical modeling. The main goal of the class is to learn how to translate
problems from "real-life" into a mathematical model and how to use mathematics to solve the problem.  
The domain of applicability of mathematics is huge and covers much of the natural sciences, but mathematics plays a central role
in modern economics, and increasingly in social sciences. 

In this class we will pick a number of topics from games and gambling, economics, social sciences, but also magic (card tricks)
and some biology (evolutionary theory) to illustrate how mathematics can be useful to analyze concrete problems.  From the 
mathematical point of view we will use elementary tools from<b>  probability, game theory, information theory, and optimization. </b>

The prerequisite for this class is a good working knowledge of calculus and linear algebra.  We will use throughout the class 
elementary notions from probability (discrete math), and  some differential equations, but Math 331 and Stat 515 are not formal prerequisites for the class. All the necessary mathematics will be introduced from scratch and motivated by examples.   


Among the problems to be discussed are 

</p><ul>
<li> The Monty Hall problem: Behind one of three doors is a prize hidden. After you pick one of the three doors, the game show host
opens one of the remaining  door and reveals no prize.  You are given the choice to keep your door or switch. What do you do?  
<br><br>

</li><li> The Gambler's ruin problem. You walk into a casino with $100 and decide to play roulette (say you will bet on red).  Your goal
is to make at least  $1000 or of course get wiped out. What is the optimal strategy in you are faced with unfair bets?   
<br><br>

</li><li> Why are duopolies better than monopolies? 
<br><br>

</li><li> Why are there as many males as females in most animals populations? 
 <br><br> 
  
</li><li> Why does it seem that if an accident happens (say a man falls on the rail track)  the more people are around the less likely it is that 
somebody helps? 
<br><br>

</li><li> What are strategies to allocate your money among various investments? 
<br><br>

</li><li> Can mathematics help you to make card tricks?

<br><br>

</li><li> Many more .......


</li></ul>

<p><br><font size="4"><b> Classnotes:</b></font><font size="4">:</font> As the class progresses I will post regularly some 
handouts.   You should use as a COMPLEMENT of your class notes, not as a substitute.  They will provide a summary of the class and a 
reference for definitions and main results.

<hr>
<p><br><font size="5"><b>Grading and assignments</b></font><font size="4">:</font>   Your grade will based on your reflective  essay  (%20), book review  (%20) homework (%30), and final project (%30). 
<br>

</p><p><br><font size="4"><b>Reflective essay: </b></font> <br>

Each student will write a 5-page, double-spaced, reflective essay on their experiences as a mathematics  
major at UMass.  As you farm your essay consider the path that led you to be a mathematics major, your 
experience taking mathematics classes, Gen Ed. courses, and other research/extracurricular activities.  

You may choose to comment specifically on some of the questions posed here:

</p><ul>
<li> Have your career goals and expectations changed since first entering UMass?<br>
</li><li> What are the most important skills and knowledge you have learned by majoring in
mathematics?<br>
</li><li>What new skills and knowledge have you acquired in the last 4 years that you did not
anticipate?<br>
</li><li> How have learning experiences in the Gen Ed courses connected to other areas?
Explore connections to interests and hobbies, interactions with friends and family,
and your professional interests and the mathematics major. <br>
</li><li>Considering your college education as a whole, how has your experience helped to
shape you as a learner and as a member of the mathematics community? What did you find most useful 
in your college education? What was least useful? What are your strengths and weaknesses as a learner?
Would you recommend this major to a friend or relative?
<br>
</li></ul>

Grading of the paper will be based on organization, clarity of expression, and the personal insights you bring 
into the paper.


<p><br><font size="4"><b>Book review.  </b></font>   

You should pick a book (popular literature, non-fiction) which explores the connections between 
mathematics and real-life applications.  Most such books contains little actual mathematics but can 
be very informative on mathematical ideas shape social and economical ideas.   You can either pick 
a book from the list above or suggest your own book (i will need to approve it then).   
 
 
Write a maximum 10-pages, double-spaced,  essay on the books addressing the following points 
 </p><ul>
<li> Explain why you chose that particular book? 
</li><li> Summarize the most important things you learned from the books. Was it well-written and/or informative? 
 How did it resonate with what you have learned as a math major.  
 <br>
</li><li> Can you imagine using any knowledge gained  from the book in your future studies, your eventual professional career, and/or your project in this class? <br>
</li></ul>


<p><br><font size="4"><b>Homework: </b></font>  Homework will be assigned regularly throughout the class.  
The homework will be graded. I expect you to do your homework regularly and carefully to assimilate the 
material.  Your homework counts as %30 percent of your grade.

<p><br><font size="4"><b>Group project: </b></font> The class will be divided in groups of three students.  Every group will select  a 
subject in consultation with  the instructor.  I am including here a list of project you could consider.  But you have some lot of freedom to 
choose your subject as long as it is related to mathematical  modeling.  And I am very much open to suggestions. 
The references above can be a good starting point to find a project.  In particular game theory is used in a very wide variety 
of contexts and will give you plenty of options, depending on your tastes  and backgrounds.  <br>

The group project as 2 parts:  <br> 
<ul>
<li> An <b> in-class presentation</b> of  around 15 minutes (+ a few minutes for questions).  This presentation is done as a group.  
The main goal of the presentation is to explain our project to your fellow students.  Make sure you spend enough time to explain the 
problem and give a quick summary of your findings. 
</li><li> The second part is <b> a paper </b> which is written  individually by each member of the group.  I DO NOT want three times  
the same paper. If, in your group, you have divided the work and considered different aspects, your paper may certainly reflect this, but each 
paper should present the whole project in its entirety.  <br>
There is no lower or upper bound on the length of the paper since your topic may request more or less space.  But being precise and concise 
are two necessary attributes of well-written mathematics. <br> 
Your paper should adress the following points. 
<ul>
<li> Motivation for your choice of topic. 
</li><li>  Modeling issues. How hard  is it to translate your model in mathematics? 
</li><li> What are your sources? Gives references to the literature. 
</li><li> A clean presentation of the mathematics involved.  Make your results clear.  If the computations are long, present your main finding and put the computation in an appendix. 
</li><li> A summary of your findings and open questions.
</li><li> If in your presentation in class you use slides, please attach them as an appendix (or better send me the file).
</li></ul>
</li></ul>

<!-- <BR><B>Project presentation</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=4>:</FONT>  The group presentations will take place on the last two classes of the 
semester as well as in the two-hour time slot reserved for the final exam. You should plan for a 15 minutes presentation  + a few minutes for questions.
